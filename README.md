# Simon Game

In this project i decided to do a normal Simon game. It is a memory game where you have to follow the sequence and copy the sequence correctly to move on.
When you get futher on in the game you will have several colours to rememeber in order. The game gets harder the longer you play! 

### Features

* In this project the buttons flash and the user is to copy the sequence and click the correct button.
* If user fails to select the color, the game will over.
